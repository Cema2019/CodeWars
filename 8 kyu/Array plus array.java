/*I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. 
I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.*/

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class Sum {
  public static int arrayPlusArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
      return Stream.of(arr1, arr2)
                    .flatMapToInt(Arrays::stream)
                    .sum();
  }
}
